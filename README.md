# 📝 My Tech Blog

Welcome to my personal blog!  
I write about **Cloud Computing, Java, DSA, Linux, DevOps, RHCSA preparation, and my learning journey**.  
This space helps me document what I learn and share it with others.

## 🌟 Why I Started This Blog

I believe that:
- Writing improves understanding  
- Sharing helps the community

So this blog tracks my daily/weekly progress as I grow into a **Cloud Engineer**.
