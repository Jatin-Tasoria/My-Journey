# Introduction To Linux

Despite what is commonly believed Linux is technically  a **Kernel**.

A kernel is a core component of operating system which acts as a bridge between Hardware and Software.

The term **Linux** is often used colloquially to refer to complete Operating System, which is technically incorrect. A complete OS does nt only includes Kernel but also various libraries, user interfaces, etc.

Linux Distribution or Distro fr short on other end are complete Operating System that combines Linux kernel with various other tools. These includes Red Hat, Ubuntu and Debian.

## Linux Distribution Families
Linux Distributions are grouped into *Families* based on their **base system**.
These are:
- Debian-based: Stability, vast software repositories, strong community.

- RHEL-based: Enterprise-grade, long-term support, security compliance.

- Arch-based: Cutting-edge, rolling updates, high customization.

- SUSE-based: Powerful admin tools, choice of stable or rolling releases.

- Independent: Unique approaches, specialized use cases.
