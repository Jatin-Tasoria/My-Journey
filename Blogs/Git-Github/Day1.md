You may have heard Git is a **Version Control System**, but what exactly is it.

**Version Control System** or **VCS** is a system that tracks and manages changes to a file.
### Key Features:-
- *Change Tracking*: Every modification to the codebase is recorded, including details about who made the 
  change, when it was made, and why.

- *Collaboration*: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work, 
  thanks to branching and merging.

- *Rollback Capability*: Developers can revert to earlier versions of the code if something goes wrong.

- *Branching and Merging*: Teams can create branches for features or bug fixes and merge them back into 
  the main codebase once completed.

- *Backup and Recovery*: VCS acts as a safeguard, allowing recovery of previous versions in case of errors 
  or data loss.

## What is GitHub?

A Coffee shop that manages multiple Coffees.

GitHub is a Platform that helps a Developer share his/her *Idea Or Project* with various other Developers
throughout the world.
